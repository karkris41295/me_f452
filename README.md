# Composite material thickness calculator

Engineers often want to use the least amount of material possible in designing their products, think about badminton racket or the chairs you sit down on. Composites are roughly speaking, sets of thin materials stacked on top of each other. 

We can reduce the thickness of our material layers by changing:
1. The order we stack the materials in, for example (A on top of B) or (B on top of A)
2. By changing the stacking angle, for example, it is easier to break two layers stacked perfectly on each other or criss-cross on top of each other?

These MATLAB codes use the Tsai-Hill theory to calculate when composites will break under certain loading conditions using different stacking angles and stacking orders. The codes were written as a part of a Composite Materials and Design course.

More details on the working of the code can be found in the PDF file in the repository.
